# SC2002 Project

## Setup Instruction
To run this app, make sure that you have installed Java on your device. The Java files have already been compiled, and you only need to execute the program. To do this, follow the steps below:

1. Open your console or terminal application.
2. Navigate to the src folder located within the SC2002Project folder by entering the appropriate cd command.
3. To run the application, type java App and press Enter. This will start the app and initialize all necessary data.

The application will load the initial data, which is set to match the data provided on the assignment page in NTULearn. After completing your testing, please ensure you exit the application properly to save any changes you made to the database. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Log out of the application to reveal the Quit option.
2. Select the Quit option to close the application gracefully.

Avoid using `Ctrl + C` to terminate the application abruptly, as this may result in unsaved changes to the database. The system only stores data when the application is closed properly using the Quit option.


## The database / data files
The database is stored as CSV files located within the "files" folder, which can be found inside the 'src' folder. To ensure the proper functioning of the app, please refrain from opening the CSV files while the app is running. Doing so may result in a failure to update the CSV files when the user exits the system. The system interacts with the database only during two key moments: initially, when data is loaded, and finally, when data is saved.


## Javadoc
The Javadoc documentation can be accessed in the "Complete Documentation" folder. To view the entire documentation, simply open the index.html file.

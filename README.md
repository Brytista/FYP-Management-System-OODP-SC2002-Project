# SC2002 Project

## Setup Instruction
The java files are already compiled. You just need to run it. To do it, open your console program (e.g. CMD), then navigate to the src folder inside the SC2002Project folder. Then type `java App`. This will run the app and initialize all the necessary data. Make sure you have installed Java on your device. Once the app run, it will initialize all the data. The initial data is set to match the initial data provided in the assignment site at NTULearn. Once you are done with the testing, please quit the application properly. Do not abruptly stop it using `ctrl + C`, because this will result in your changes not being saved in the database. The system only stores data once the app is being closed properly using the `Quit` option that appear once user log out. 


## The database / data files
The database is stored in the form of CSV files which is inside the "files" folder inside the 'src' folder. While the app is running, please don't open the CSV files. Because in the end, the system would fail at attempting to update the CSV, once the user quits from the system. The system would interact with the database only twice: at the beginning when data is initialized and at the end when data is saved.
